# 3commas-postman

A "Plug and Play" postman collection created from the official swagger doc. 
The signature is created automatically.

You just need to add your own api key-secret pair as the THREE_COMMAS_API_KEY and THREE_COMMAS_API_SECRET collection variables.

Some requests require write permissions. Which exactly can be found on the official repo:
